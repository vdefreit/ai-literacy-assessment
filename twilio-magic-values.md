# Twilio Magic Values

## Overview
The Twilio Magic guides how we show up each day, how we treat each other, and how we build at Twilio. It is our core operating system and what separates us from other companies. The values and principles of the Twilio Magic are the words we use to describe our culture and guide it forward.

## The Four Values

### 1. We are Builders
**Core Value:** We love hard problems. We believe in people's indomitable power to create a better world. We do this through ingenuity and resourcefulness. We reject the "can't be done" attitude. We believe that with bold ideas and fearless iteration we can resolve our customers' most challenging problems.

**Principles:**
- **Wear the Customers' Shoes** - Be obsessively customer focused. Build empathy and with a spirit of hospitality. Build for the entire customer base, not just one customer.
- **Draw the Owl** - Embrace uncertainty when there aren't step-by-step instructions. Write the instruction book for others to follow.
- **Write it Down** - Blueprint plans and align others around them. Use clear, concise, thoughtful writing to convey ideas and document decisions.
- **Organize into Small Teams** - Stay connected to customers, clear on mission, empowered to make decisions. Define team-APIs for how to engage.
- **Live the Spirit of Challenge** - Encourage constructive challenge. Expect to defend ideas with data and logic.
- **Learn Cheap Lessons** - Design measurable experiments. Test and iterate. Learn quickly and cheaply through prototypes.

### 2. We are Owners
**Core Value:** We take accountability and see things through. We take the long view, sweat the details, and think about how our work makes Twilio better every day. We recognize that we do our best work when we feel both empowered and accountable for outcomes.

**Principles:**
- **Trust is the #1 Thing We Sell** - Earn trust by knowing your stuff, doing what you say, and focusing on others' needs. Trust is built over time.
- **Think Long Term** - Make decisions that create the best long-term outcomes. Don't mortgage the future for short-term fixes.
- **Have a Point of View** - Know your business inside out. Develop recommendations. Have strong opinions, loosely held.
- **Ruthlessly Prioritize** - Focus on what matters most. Be honest about what you can and can't do given your constraints.
- **Be Frugal** - Treat company resources like your own. Save money where possible, but never at the expense of customer, product, or quality.
- **Pick up the Trash** - Sweat the details. Help out wherever you can. Don't wait for someone else to fix small problems.
- **Disagree and Commit** - Have honest, open debate. Once a decision is made, commit fully even if it wasn't your preferred choice.

### 3. We are Curious
**Core Value:** We see ourselves as works in progress. We know that we don't have all the answers, so we humbly seek the truth and strive to learn from our mistakes. As individuals, as a company, and in our products, we seek continual progress over perfection.

**Principles:**
- **Be Humble** - Recognize you don't hold all the answers. Everyone has something valuable they can teach you. You are a work in progress.
- **Embrace the Uncomfortable** - Be comfortable being uncomfortable. That's where learning happens. Growth requires vulnerability and trying new things.
- **Seek the Truth** - Find the best answer, not the loudest one. Put aside politics and titles. When things go wrong, it's a time to learn, not blame.
- **Share Problems, Not Just Solutions** - Invite others into the problem rather than prescribing your solution. This gets the best thinking and energy.
- **Seek Progress Over Perfection** - Experiment through constant testing, user feedback, and iteration. Choose iterative progress over designing the perfect solution that no one uses.

### 4. We are Positrons
**Core Value:** We are genuine in our drive to help and empower others. We believe that caring is critical. We ask how we can help. We stand up and work for what we believe is good and right for our customers, our company, our communities and the world at large.

**Principles:**
- **Be Genuine** - Be yourself, complete with quirks and eccentricities. Celebrate diverse perspectives and ways of thinking.
- **No Shenanigans** - Always deal in an honest, direct, and transparent way. No politics or games.
- **Empower Others** - Unleashing human potential in others is the key to our success. Invest in others.
- **Be Inclusive** - Create an environment where all people are actively valued for their work and treated respectfully. Welcome and celebrate diversity.
- **Be Respectful** - Show consideration and regard for others. Listen well and be open to input. Being right is not an excuse for being a jerk.
- **Ask How You Can Help** - Proactively offer help to others. Teams are made up of folks who help each other.

## The Twilio Magic as a System

The four values work as a system. Practice to be balanced in the center of the four values. The principles are levers for your actions to bring your values back into balance.

**When values are missing:**
- **Missing Positron:** Great work delivered, but others feel beat-up, deflated, or ignored
- **Missing Curious:** Expert mentality limits creativity, contributions are devalued, people feel disrespected
- **Missing Builders:** Lots of theories and talk, but not much action or results
- **Missing Owners:** Chaotic, lacking prioritization, rush jobs, failure to deliver quality results
