Process Clarity:  When instructing AI tools and systems…
Not Started - I ask the AI for a "final result" without explaining the steps it should take, leaving the logic entirely up to the model's default settings.
Compliant - I provide the AI with a standard operating procedure to follow, ensuring it replicates our existing manual steps accurate
Competent - I can explain the logic behind each relevant step of a process, allowing the AI to troubleshoot its own bottlenecks and reason through complex tasks.
Creative -  I deconstruct tasks to identify parallel processes and enable AI systems to work effectively by balancing detail with ambiguity, leveraging the natural strength of the selected model


Performance Expectations: When setting expectations for projects while working with AI tools, 
Not Started - I do not set performance standards, I typically realize that work is subpar once it is finished and delivered
Compliant -  I provide the AI with a basic checklist of constraints to follow, ensuring the output meets my expectations
Competent - I give the AI specific examples of good vs great work, improving the model’s ability to anticipate the quality of work that I’m expecting 
Creative -   I collaborate with AI to brainstorm and improve the overall quality of my work before implementing a pre-set plan without considering how this work might be better


Context Aggregation:  When providing context to AI models...
Not Started - I don’t often know what types of resources or items are safe, or relevant to share with the model
Compliant - I provide relevant context that keeps with my organization’s AI acceptable use policy, helping the AI to produce satisfactory outputs
Competent - I think critically about what types of information are relevant, to avoid overloading the model’s context window and improve output quality
Creative -  I leverage multi-modal capabilities, manage context window capacity and continuously share updated snippets of my work to the AI to build context over time




Section 3: Discernment 
Discernment is about evaluating AI outputs and behavior with a critical eye. As a leader, your role is to act as the final filter, ensuring that the logic, accuracy, and quality of an output meet your standards rather than accepting results at face value.


Domain/Craft Expertise: When evaluating AI-generated outputs…


Not Started: I rely on AI or my peers to judge quality, as I am still establishing the best practices and benchmarks on what ‘good looks like’ for this specific craft.
Compliant: I check the results against our established team standards and internal benchmarks to ensure the output is safe and meets minimum functional needs.
Competent: I apply my current understanding of industry standards to identify when the AI's guidance is accurate and where it fails to meet professional quality.
Creative: I leverage my expertise to push the AI beyond standard strategies, recognizing new ways to solve old problems through advanced technologies

Logic and Reasoning: When auditing the "thinking" behind an AI's plan...


Not Started: I focus almost entirely on the final recommendation, sometimes missing gaps in the model's underlying logic or reasoning
Compliant: I follow a basic step-by-step review to see if the AI's plan makes sense and aligns with our core operational tasks and team requirements.
Competent: I use available information to understand the AI's strategy to find logical gaps or hidden assumptions, ensuring the path to the solution is robust and defensible.
Creative: I stress-test the AI's reasoning from multiple viewpoints, identifying potential biases or systemic flaws before they can impact the final outcome.

Coaching for Improvement: When providing feedback to refine AI outputs...
Not Started:  I rely on a gut feeling for whether the AI met expectations, providing feedback that focuses on what is wrong rather than how to fix it.
